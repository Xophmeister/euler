# Problem 4

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009=91Ã—99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit
numbers.

## Solution

We brute-force this: Multiply 3-digit numbers and check for palindromes.
I'm sure optimisations are possible!
