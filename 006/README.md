# Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

> 1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

> (1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten
natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one
hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Solution

This has an analytical solution. The sum of squares, from 1 to n -- the
*Square Pyramidal* number -- is (2n³ + 3n² + n)/6. The square of the
sum, from 1 to n, is n²(n + 1)²/4. Thus their difference is given by:

> n(n + 1)(n - 1)(3n + 2) / 12
